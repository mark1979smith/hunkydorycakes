		<p class="testimonial">&quot;A Hunkydory tea party makes a wonderful present for lots of reasons; firstly the afternoon tea... delicate sandwiches, indulgent cream cake and scones (all home made of course!) along with tea in the prettiest china cups. Secondly, Anna brought everything to the house, turning the dining room into the prefect setting for an afternoon with friends; we didn't have to lift a finger and felt so spoilt! But for me, the best part of the afternoon had to be the cupcake workshop session - so much fun and such tasty results! All in all it's a great way to spend an afternoon; I totally recommend it.&quot;<br /><span class="author">Ruby Carr</span></p>
		<p class="testimonial">&quot;I really love baking but I'd never really knew what to do with icing - my cakes always looked like a five year old had made them. I really enjoyed the icing workshop because the cakes decorated looked amazing and there were no tears making them - quite the opposite! Everyone really got into making their cupcakes look colourful and arty. It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with friends. The tea party was fantastic. It looked like every little girls dream! Roses, love hearts, china, delicious cakes and tea! The table layout made it feel really special and I liked that the teacups were labeled with our names. It wasn't quite as crazy as the mad hatters tea party but it was definitely as much fun.&quot;<br /><span class="author">Laura Barton</span></p>
		<p class="testimonial">&quot;Thank you Hunkdory Cakes for making the perfect centre piece for our celebration, although it was Rory's special day your cake had as many comments as he did! Everyone was commenting on how amazing &amp; cute the cake looked and were speechless when it cam to eating it, it was delicious. Nothing apart from the booties was left&quot;<br />&quot;Anna you were so considerate and thoughtful turning our design requests into reality, we wish you all the best in your future ventures.&quot;<br /><span class="author">Laura David &amp; Rory X</span></p>
		<p class="testimonial">&quot;A perfect afternoon!<br />A surprise birthday afternoon tea with homemade cakes baked freshly for us that very morning. This really was the best birthday surprise - every detail was thought of, from my favourite cake, to the lovely vintage china, to the flower petals and personal hand made name cards. Really can't thank you enough for providing the loveliest way to spend an afternoon with friends... we'll be having afternoon tea with you again very soon!&quot;<br /><span class="author">Jessica Barnes</span></p>
		<p class="testimonial">&quot;Haven't had this much fun with cakes since I was a kid...if only I was allowed to take the entire tube of delicious butter-cream icing home!!! There is a definite skill in creating the perfect cupcake and although I seemed to be eating the butter-cream faster than I was applying it, the cupcakes we made (with a little help and guidance!) were brilliant presents after the workshop... I would like to take all the credit, but the chocolate around my mouth may have given away what I was actually doing...&quot;<br /><span class="author">Corinna Lincoln</span></p>
		<p class="testimonial">&quot;Thank you for a brilliantly organised afternoon tea party. Love that you took away any stress or worry and planned every detail for us. The table settings were just beautiful and transformed the dining table, felt like we were attending a special event at home! The cupcake workshop after tea, was again, brilliantly organised, with every detail thought out and everything we needed provided. Doubled up in laughter making the chocolate lovepops lollipops! BIG thank you for organising everything so well and all the delicious cakes, the whole afternoon was a chance to have fun with friends without having to be a grown up and go out for dinner. Thank you for a lovely chocolate filled day! Xxx&quot;<br /><span class="author">Karen Short</span></p>
